        The BioSimulators standards are a set of formats and conventions for (a)
        describing the specifications of simulation tools (e.g., supported
        modeling frameworks, simulation algorithms, and modeling formats) and
        (b) the syntax and semantics of the inputs and outputs of biosimulation
        software tools. Collectively, the standards ensure that (a)
        investigators can communicate the specifications of simulation tools,
        (b) investigators can use this information to find simulation tools that
        have specific capabilities, (c) investigators can consistently use the
        same syntax to execute simulations with multiple simulation tools (e.g.,
        same paths to the same files in the same formats), and (d) simulation
        tools produce consistent outputs (reports and plots at consistent paths
        in consistent formats).
      </p>

      <p>The BioSimulators standards encompass multiple standards:</p>
      <ul class="vertically-spaced">
        <li>
          <b
            ><a [routerLink]="['/conventions', 'simulator-specs']"
              >Format for describing the specifications of simulation tools</a
            ></b
          >: This format enables investigators to describe the modeling
          frameworks, simulation algorithms, and modeling formats supported by
          each simulation tool. The format also enables investigators to
          describe the parameters of each algorithm, their data types, and their
          default values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a [routerLink]="['/conventions', 'simulator-interfaces']"
              >Conventions for command-line interfaces for simulation tools</a
            ></b
          >: These conventions ensure that (a) simulation tools support
          consistent syntax for executing simulations and (b) simulation tools
          produce outputs at consistent locations in consistent formats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a [routerLink]="['/conventions', 'simulator-images']"
              >Conventions for Docker images for simulation tools</a
            ></b
          >: These conventions ensure that the entry points of containerized
          simulation tools support consistent syntax for executing simulations
          and that containerized simulation tools provide consistent metadata.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a [routerLink]="['/conventions', 'simulation-experiments']"
              >Conventions for simulation experiments with SED-ML</a
            ></b
          >: These conventions ensure that the community consistently encodes
          simulation experiments into SED-ML. This includes conventions for
          targets for implicit elements of models which are not directly defined
          in models (e.g., reduced costs of FBA reactions, shadow prices of FBA
          species). This also delineates how to encode the values of model
          attribute changes and algorithm parameters into SED-ML, including
          encoding enumerated values, lists, dictionaries, and other complex
          data structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            ><a [routerLink]="['/conventions', 'simulation-reports']"
              >Format for data for reports (<code>sedml:report</code>) and plots
              (<code>sedml:plot2D</code>, <code>sedml:plot3D</code>) of
              simulation results</a
            ></b
          >: This format ensures that simulation tools produce data for reports
          and plots in a consistent format (e.g., HDF5) with consistent shapes
          (e.g., rows: data set (<code>sedml:dataSet</code>), columns: time)
          that can be consistently visualized and interpreted.

            ><biosimulations-icon icon="link"></biosimulations-icon
          ></a>
          is a powerful format for describing interactive, two-dimensional data
          visualizations which make visualizations re-usable by separately
          capturing the visual marks of a visualization and how they should be
          painted with data. These guidelines provide recommendations for how to
          use Vega to visualize the results of simulation experiments captured
          by SED-ML reports.

              ></b
            >: BioSimulators recommends using the OMEX Metadata RDF-XML format to annotate the meaning, provenance, and credibility of COMBINE/OMEX archives and their contents. These guidelines recommend specific predicates and objects.

              ></b
            >: This format enables simulation tools to communicate their
            progress in the execution of COMBINE/OMEX archives, such as which
            tasks have been executed, which tasks are queued for execution, and
            which tasks will be skipped because, for example, they require
            features of SED-ML that the simulation tool does not support.
          </p>

          <p>
            This format enables simulation tools to communicate the following
            information:
          </p>

          <ul class="vertically-spaced">
            <li>
              The status and outcome of the COMBINE archive and each SED
              document, task, and output (queued, running, succeeded, skipped,
              or failed).
            </li>
            <li>
              Information about the simulation function that was used and the
              arguments that were used.
            </li>
            <li>
              The standard output/error produced by the COMBINE archive and each
              SED document, task, and output.
            </li>
            <li>
              The duration of the execution of the COMBINE archive and each SED
              document, task, and output.
            </li>
            <li>
              The reason for each SED document, task or output that was skipped.
            </li>
            <li>The reason for any failed SED documents, tasks, or outputs.</li>

      <ul class="vertically-spaced">
        <li>
          <b>Sharing modeling studies:</b> The standards make it easier for
          investigators to execute diverse simulations involved in
          collaborations with different colleagues and analyze their outputs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reusing modeling studies:</b> Similarly, the standards make it
          easier for investigators to reuse published modeling studies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Peer reviewing modeling studies:</b> Similarly, the standards also
          make it easier for investigators to review modeling studies prior to
          publication in journal articles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Comparing simulation tools:</b> By making it easier to execute
          multiple simulation tools, the standards make it easier to compare the
          outputs of multiple simulation tools. The ability to easily compare
          simulation tools, in turn, makes it easier to find errors in
          simulation tools, debug simulation tools, and drive standardization in
          the implementation of simulation algorithms across tools.
